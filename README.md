# About Me
## 👨‍🎓 Currently, I’m a student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I’m part of the IEEE pilot class, where I’m actively delving into Information Security and Computer Science and Technology.
## I enjoy bringing the problem - solving skills I've learned from my studies to the digital world. 
Through my academic journey, I've gained hands - on experience in designing security - focused software systems, and I’m eager to contribute to open - source projects related to information security, software engineering, and computer science.
## Away from my studies
I’m really into all ball sports. Football and badminton are my absolute favorites. I’ve been on my school's football team, and those experiences have taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and strategic thinking. I believe these same principles apply when collaborating on GitHub projects.
## I’m extremely excited to work with all of you in this amazing community. 
Whether it’s a small bug fix or a large - scale software development project, I’m committed to actively participating, sharing ideas, and jointly creating top - notch open - source projects.
# Let’s connect! Looking forward to building something great together.
